# My Rust Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I learn the Rust programming language through the official Rust book available on the [Rust website](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). The learning materials and exercises are organized by days.

## What's Inside

- **Daily Progress**: Each folder represents a day of my journey, containing code examples, exercises, and notes.
- **Reflections**: My personal reflections and insights on the key concepts I've learned each day.

## How to Navigate

- **By Days**: Browse through the folders organized by days to see my daily progress.
- **Running the Code**: If you'd like to run any code examples, ensure Rust is installed on your system and use the Rust compiler (`rustc`) to compile and run the code.

## Progress Overview

- **Day 1**: Introduction to Rust, Setting Up, Hello World.
- **Day 2**: Understanding Ownership, Borrowing, and References.
- **Day 3**: Structs
- **Day 4**: Enum, pattern matching and option
- **Day 5**: The Module System in Rust
- **Day 6**: Rust Common Collections - Vectors, Strings, and HashMaps
