# Day 3: Learning Rust Structs and Methods

On Day 3 of my Rust learning journey, I explored structs, methods, instances, and more. Here's a summary of what I've learned and practiced.

## Structs
- **Named Fields**: Created custom data types using `struct`, defining named fields as in the `User` struct.
- **Tuple Structs**: Also explored tuple structs that allow you to name the entire tuple, like `Color` and `Point`.
- **Updating Instances**: Demonstrated how to update instances of structs and used struct update syntax.

## Methods and Functions
- **Associated Functions**: Defined methods on structs using the `impl` block, as in the `Rectangle` struct.
- **Ownership & Borrowing**: Practiced ownership rules within method signatures.

## Other Concepts
- **Debug Printing**: Learned to use the `derive(Debug)` attribute for pretty-printing structs.
- **Building Complex Functions**: Created functions that return structs and work with tuple parameters.

## Example Code
The code of Day 3 includes practical examples such as calculating areas of rectangles, holding relationships between rectangles, and working with user data.

## Insights
Day 3 provided a deeper understanding of Rust's powerful features related to structs and methods. I learned how to work with custom data types, define methods, and understand ownership within method calls.
