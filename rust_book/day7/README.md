### Day 7: Advanced Rust Features - Error Handling and Generics

Today, I delved deeper into Rust by exploring advanced features like error handling and generics. My exploration is split into two separate projects: `day7_1` for error handling and `day7_2` for generics.

#### Error Handling in Rust (`day7_1`)

Rust's error handling is unique, prioritizing type safety and allowing graceful error recovery.

- **Panicking**: Using `panic!` macro to stop program execution.
- **Result Enum**: Demonstrates Rust's built-in `Result<T, E>` type for error handling.
- **Unwrapping**: Using methods like `unwrap`, `expect`, and `unwrap_or_else` for handling errors.
- **Propagating Errors**: Returning and propagating errors using `?` operator.

```rust
// In errors.rs
pub mod errors {
    // ... code here ...
}
```

#### Generics in Rust (`day7_2`)

Generics enable code reusability without compromising on type safety.

- **Generic Functions**: Creating generic functions using trait bounds.
- **Generic Structs**: Demonstrates generic data types in struct definitions.
- **Method Implementations on Generic Structs**: Implementing methods on structs with generic types.
- **Enums with Generics**: Utilizing generics in enum definitions.
  
```rust
// In generics.rs
pub mod generic {
    // ... code here ...
}
```

### How to Run:

**For day7_1 (Error Handling)**
1. Navigate to the `day7_1` directory.
2. Uncomment the desired function calls in the `main.rs`.
3. Run using `cargo run`.

**For day7_2 (Generics)**
1. Navigate to the `day7_2` directory.
2. Uncomment the desired function calls in the `main.rs`.
3. Run using `cargo run`.

Project Structure:

```

```

Through these exercises, I've gained a deeper appreciation for Rust's type system, its emphasis on safety, and its powerful features like generics and error handling.
